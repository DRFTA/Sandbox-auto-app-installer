# Sandbox-auto-app-installer


Adds a start up script to Sandbox to automatically install Winget, Chocolatey, VScode, Terminal, Chrome, Git, Notepad++, 7zip, Python and Nodejs. Every time you start Sandbox

Tested and working on 3 diffrent Windows 11 PC's

Got sick of having to download things everytime in sandbox. So made a little script to make my life a bit easier.

To Install
1. Download the Sandbox.bat file
2. Open Terminal 
3. cd into the dir you downloaded Sandbox.bat to EG: cd "C:\Users\<YOURUSERPROFILE>\Downloads\"
4. Type: "Sandbox.bat"  without the quotes, then hit enter.

Let it do its thing, then once its done every time you open up Sandbox it will auto install Winget, Chocolatey, VScode, Terminal, Chrome, Git, Notepad++, 7zip, Python and Nodejs to your fresh Sandbox. 

Feel free to change it to suit your needs or make it better. 
Just re-run the script again with your changes and it will update Sandbox to load up with your changes everytime.
